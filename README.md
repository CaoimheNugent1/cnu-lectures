# Computing and Numerics - Lectures and videos

This repository will contain all code shown in the weekly videos, and will also be updated with the code we work on during lectures on Wednesdays.

You can create a codespace directly from here if you'd like to play around with the code. If you come back to your codespace after new material has been added, don't forget to **pull** the changes from here into your codespace.
